## ROAD TO REACT, EXERCISES AND NOTES

This repo contains the notes, exercises, and tips that I have learned in "Road to React" by Robin Wieruch. In it, you will find exercises and notes from the "hacker-stories" exercises listed within the book. These notes are for my own reference and for anybody else out there looking for examples or notes for their own uses.
